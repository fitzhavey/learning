1. A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.
	- [ ] True
	- [x] False

2. True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.
	- [ ] True
	- [x] False

3. A program counter:
	- [ ] counts the number of primitive operations executed by the program.
	- [ ] counts the number of primitive operations comprising a complex operation.
	- [x] points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.
	- [ ] remembers how many times a program has been executed.

4. What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?
	- [ ] The computer tests each instruction to ensure it will not harm the circuitry.
	- [ ] The computer executes the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line.
	- [x] The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
	- [ ] The computer slowly executes instructions so that we can follow its progress, rather than running a program at full speed.

5. In order to compute everything that is computable, every computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.
	- [ ] True
	- [x] False

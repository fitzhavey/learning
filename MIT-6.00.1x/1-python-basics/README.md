# Week 1: Introduction to Python

## Overview of course:
- learn computational modes of thinking
- master the art of computational problem solving
- make computers do what you want them to

## Topics:
- represent knowledge with data structures
- iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
- abstraction of procedures and data types
- organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
- complexity of algorithms

## What does a computer do?
- Fundamentally:
	- performs calculations
	- remembers results
- What kinds of calculations?
	- built-in to the language
	- ones that you define as a programmer

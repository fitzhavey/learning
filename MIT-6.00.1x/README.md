# MIT 6.00.1x

This course is a write up of the content in MIT's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+1T2020/course/).

I first did this course when I was 15, many moons ago. Formalising its content and analysing it with the perspective I have now should hopefully be a very fruitfull process.

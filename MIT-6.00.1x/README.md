# MIT 6.00.1x

This course is a write up of the content in MIT's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+1T2020/course/).

## Overview of this course:
- learn computational modes of thinking
- master the art of computational problem solving
- make computers do what you want them to

## Topics:
- represent knowledge with data structures
- iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
- abstraction of procedures and data types
- organize and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
- complexity of algorithms

## Exercise Questions:
The exercise files are included with the correct answers along with the course notes.

_I first did this course when I was 15, many moons ago. Formalising its content and analysing it with the perspective I have now should hopefully be a very fruitful process._
